### How to Register
To register, first navigate to the main page of the web site. Then, click the button titled "Register" in the top-right portion of the screen. A simple modal will
appear asking for your username, password, and e-mail. Providing your e-mail is not required, but you must submit a username and password. After registering, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page.

### How to Login
If you have already registered before, you can login by simply entering your username and password into the appropriate text fields in the top-right portion of the screen and clicking the "Login" button just to the right. This will redirect you to the home page.

### How to Navigate Humor Content
There are several ways to navigate through the available content. The simplest is to simply go through all of the content sequentially using the previous and next buttons to either side of the humor content (in the center of the page). You can do this whether you are logged in or not. If you are logged in, you may also navigate content by clicking the "Recommend" button located near the top of the page. This will show you a content that you have not yet rated that we believe will interest you based on your past ratings.
