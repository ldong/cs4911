### How to Register
To register, first navigate to the main page of the web site. Then, click the button titled "Register" in the top-right portion of the screen. A simple modal will
appear asking for your username, password, and e-mail. Providing your e-mail is not required, but you must submit a username and password. After registering, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page.

### How to Login
If you have already registered before, you can login by simply entering your username and password into the appropriate text fields in the top-right portion of the screen and clicking the "Login" button just to the right. This will redirect you to the home page.

### How to Navigate Humor Content
There are several ways to navigate through the available content. The simplest is to simply go through all of the content sequentially using the previous and next buttons to either side of the humor content (in the center of the page). You can do this whether you are logged in or not. If you are logged in, you may also navigate content by clicking the "Recommend" button located near the top of the page. This will show you a content that you have not yet rated that we believe will interest you based on your past ratings.

### How to Add New Content
To add content, you must first be logged in to your user account. Once you are logged in, click the "Add Content" button near the top of the page next to the "Recommend" button. A modal will pop up similar to the registration form. The top area of the form will require you to select the content type you are submitting: image, video, or text. If it is a video, it currently must be a YouTube video. You must also give the content a title as well as supply the URL/message of the content. If it is a video, give the ID at the end of the YouTube URL instead of the full YouTube URL. Currently, only .png, .jpg, and .gif images are supported. Once added, you will be redirected to the home page with your recently added content displayed.

### How to Rate Content
If you want to rate content, you can do so by simply selecting the desired rating directly under the content itself. The rating system is a 1-5 scale, so rate accordingly. You can also flag content as inappropriate or add it to your favorites by clicking the respective buttons on the bottom-right side of the content.
