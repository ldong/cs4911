,"A guy walks into a bar with an alligator. It's about 10 feet long. The bartender flips out and says, ""Hey buddy, you gotta get that son of a bitch outta here. It's going to bite one of my customers and I'm going to get sued."" The guy says, ""No no no, it's a tame alligator. I'll prove it to you."" He picks up the alligator and puts it on the bar. Then he unzips his pants, pulls out his package and sticks it in the alligator's mouth. The alligator just keeps his mouth open. After about 5 minutes, he pulls it out of the alligator's mouth and zips up his pants and says, ""See, I told you it was a tame alligator. Anybody else want to try it?"" The drunk down at the end of the bar says, ""Yeah, I'd like to try it but I don't think I can hold my mouth open that long!""","Text","Alligator",1,1,0,0,"2014-04-15 16:35:00",0,0

,"A Catholic priest, a Baptist preacher and a rabbi fish in a lake. The preacher has to use the bathroom, so he walks across the water, does his business and walks back. Then the rabbi has to go, so he walks across the water, does his business and walks back. The Catholic has to go, but when he gets out he falls into the water. He swims back, gets back into the boat, and says, ""God, let me walk across the water."" He tries again and falls into the water, swims back, tries again and falls again. The Baptist leans over to the rabbi and asks, ""Do you think we should tell him where the stepping stones are?""","Text","Walking on Water",1,3,0,0,"2014-04-15 16:35:00",0,0
